I cannot add tags to a note shared from MEC. A drop-down list appears but is empty and would not allow for items (Tags) to be created.
I find strange that we only could create them from the master. Does it work for you on your BM account?

Not sure. I'll check tomorrow as I am on my phone. I moved this note to the forum as it was in the PM&A notebook.
