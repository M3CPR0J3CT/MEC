The idea came to me as part of the Electrical Architecture Draft and Interactions Analysis around a Crash scenario.
Currently seen as a redundancy to the Terminal records acquired via the Down Link so that info is captured for Incestgation should the datalink be interrupted.
I thought we could perform a quick analysis to select the Flight parameters and MEC Variables we might be interested in, define a Recirding Frequency and see what kind of storage volume we would need.
We could implement a roll-over rule so that the last x mn of the Flight are recorded, assuming the rest would have been acquired by the Terminal already.
