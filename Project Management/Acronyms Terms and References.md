## Maintenance Levels
Level 1     Field basic replacement operations (batteries, mission-specific equipment, etc.). No tooling required.
Level 2     Base repairing operations (worn or damaged parts, etc.). Specific Tooling and Documentation required.
Level 3     Base heavy repairing or retrofitting operations. Specific Tooling, Documentation and Preliminary Analysis required.

## Concept of Operations
Also abbreviated CONOPS. This is a set-based Conception activity that is preliminar to a robust Architecture definition. It is based on a small number of top-level Scenarii which are defined in conjunction with and deemed representative of the majority of System Use Cases all Stakeholders.
