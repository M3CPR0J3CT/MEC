# Concept Phase
- [x] G to rework note.
- [x] G to number the features in the Interaction Diagram in Note ‘Interactions Analysis’.
- [x] G to assess the benefits of an SADT for the Project in addition to the FAST. > Started on the 2016 06 01 in the corresponding Note.
- [x] B to review and comment the Functional Analysis dated 2016 05 30.
- [x] B & G to define each Item of the Operational Environment to help with the upcoming definition of accurate MEC Technical Requirements (i.e. MEC.Ri). See Table 2 of Interactions Analysis and ensure there are no duplication with the § Terms.
- [x] G to think of renaming Functional Analysis within Functional Analysis (probably Interactions Analysis).
- [x] B & G to draft a Procedure implementing the Operational Sequence to detail hidden constraints. > Superseded by the next Action.
- [x] B & G to write simple Representative Scenarii of typical cases of Operational Use of the System to formalise needs.
- [x]  B & G to verify that a Note carries a Correspondance/Synthesis Matrix linking Need/Requirement/Specification together.
- [x] G to investigate further into UML and Diagrams coding, SYSML and possibly OPM (marginal). > Done, cf. Technical Library/Unified Modelling Language Software, dated 2016 05 31.
- [x] G to expand MEC.F39 to detail Fail Safe requirements.
- [ ] Add SEBOK and PEBOK to the Technical Library (not here strictly, cf. suggestion of a Project To Do List in the Forum) and DSM.
- [x] G to create the DSM Matrix for initial review.
- [x] B & G to define the priorities for MEC.Fi (in the DSM).
- [x] B to complete mechanical architecture
- [x] B to complete DSM assignment of functional requirements to design areas.
- [ ] B and G to complete preliminary design to include a product baseline, electrical and mechanical architecture relative design.
- [ ] G to add a scan of his draft mech architecture



# Development Phase
- [ ] G to create a performance requirements matrix in the Master DSM and cross reference to applicable functional requirements.
