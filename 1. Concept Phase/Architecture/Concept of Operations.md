# Operational Scenarii
## Movie Makers
On a sunny day, the Pilot travels with MEC to a hilly spot to record footages of the valley for a video and capture the location of features identified during the flight for further reference.

## Territory Reconaissance
In the middle of a park, the Pilot sends MEC for an autonomous flight to map the area behind the line of sight.

## Low Collateral Strike
Mission plan for MEC to fly into a house/bunker, navigate through rooms and search for pre-planned target. Video datalink to a terminal would allow an operator to confirm target. MEC could then fire a small product to eliminate target without destroying civilians or surrounding infrastructure thus, minimising collateral damage. This also provides legal evidence that the correct target has been eliminated and negate the requirement for special forces to enter a building.

## Under the Radar
The Pilot flies MEC over a spring running in a forest and the fields nearby and records the trace. Once returned to the launch pad, MEC is sent to replay the flight but at high speed and constant low altitude.

## Chaos
On a foggy day, MEC is sent by the Pilot to exfilter an expected payload from a known open shack behind the line of sight. To minimise the risks of interception, MEC follows a different route for the return journey. MEC suddenly collides with an unexpected tree and crashes. The Pilot goes for a Search and Rescue mission to recover MEC and the precious asset.

These Scenarii will also help us to design our Verification and Validation Trials.
For this a breakdown of each Scenario into Functions will be necessary - and easy as we have progressed on the Functional Analysis.
