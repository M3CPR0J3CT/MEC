Electrical architecture sketch placed in Architecture. I'll do this on a drawing app soon. Any comments?

Cool. Have uploaded the Sketch I showed you and have attached the current Draft of its IT version. I did not understand why you had a double Tx/Rx but it might be a question of granularity of the representation. Let us discuss/amend at the next session!
Nevertheless, thinking of changing S/W for something dedicated to UML/SYSML and co.

The following Drawing formalises the Assessment Phase Electrical Architecture.
It also captures the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) anticipated, thus identifying block relevant to Phase 2 in line with the Programme Management Plan.
