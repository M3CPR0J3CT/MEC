# Todo
[ ] Fix Figures and Add Snapshots
[ ] Add DSM Master to Github.

# Matrix
The provisional Design Structure Matrix (DSM) from Fig. 1 below is based on the Interactions Analysis and its Functions List.
It is yet to be completed as per the § Review and Comments hereafter.

This is another test, but with an .xlsx attachement:


# Mapping
The Mapping from Fig. 2 is preliminary and will be fed into a DSM Software for enhanced readability and features.

G 2016 06 05
This is a first Draft of the Dependancies, based on the Interactions Diagram dated 2016 05 30.
Priorities need to be defined together.
The interdependencies easy their identification. As detailed in the Technical Library, this will be upgraded once the complete Architecture will have been drafted.

B 2016 08 05
I am working on this at the minute. It is the functional requirements as above however I am linking them the the design areas i.e. aerodynamics, propulsion etc. That way we can then each take an area and design the solution to all the associated functional requirements.
