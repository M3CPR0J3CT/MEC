# Matrix
The provisional Design Structure Matrix (DSM) from Fig. 1 below is based on the Interactions Analysis and its Functions List.
It is yet to be completed as per the ยง Review and Comments hereafter.

This is another test, but with an .xlsx attachement:


# Mapping
The Mapping from Fig. 2 is preliminary and will be fed into a DSM Software for enhanced readability and features.

This is a first Draft of the Dependancies, based on the Interactions Diagram dated 2016 05 30.
Priorities need to be defined together.
The interdependencies easy their identification. As detailed in the Technical Library, this will be upgraded once the complete Architecture will have been drafted.

I am working on this at the minute. It is the functional requirements as above however I am linking them the the design areas i.e. aerodynamics, propulsion etc. That way we can then each take an area and design the solution to all the associated functional requirements.
