# Definitions
## Maintenance Levels
| Maintenance Level | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Level 1 | Field basic replacement operations (batteries, mission-specific equipment, etc.). No tooling required. |
| Level 2 | Base repairing operations (worn or damaged parts, etc.). Specific Tooling and Documentation required. |
| Level 3 | Base heavy repairing or retrofitting operations. Specific Tooling, Documentation and Preliminary Analysis required. |

## Concept of Operations
Also abbreviated CONOPS.
This is a set-based Conception activity that is preliminar to a robust Architecture definition. It is based on a small number of top-level Scenarii which are defined in conjunction with and deemed representative of the majority of System Use Cases all Stakeholders.
