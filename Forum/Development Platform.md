[Evernote](https://evernote.com) is retained as the solution.
Decided to experiment the sharing options so that the other gets notified when a note is updated.

While embedding a chat section, Evernote did not proved to be very efficient in the management of a small team for this application. Furthermore, a recent Use Policy limiation moving the Service to a Freemium as reduced the number of devices on which an account could be used to 2.
[Trello](https://trello.com) was noticed as a good opportunity to manage the tasks.

Github is identified as a versatile alternative.
This [Repository](https://github.com/M3CPR0J3CT/MEC) was created.
